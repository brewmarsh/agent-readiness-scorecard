# Agent Cognitive Load (ACL) thresholds.
# ACL is calculated as: Complexity + (Lines of Code / 20).
# Functions exceeding these values are flagged to reduce "Hallucination Zones".
# Defaults: yellow = 10, red = 15
acl_yellow = 10
acl_red = 15

# Minimum percentage of functions that must have type hints (0-100).
# Agents need types to call functions correctly without guessing signatures.
# Default: 90
